Hi, I am Siddhartha Das,currently pursuing M.Tech in Industrial Engineering and Management from IIT Kharagpur.During my course of study, I have developed a strong interest in Operations Research and Machine Learning domain.So, I have done some projects based on Schedule Optimization, Prognostic Modelling and Stock Prices Forecasting.
So,Welcome to my repository! here, I have presented these projects on which I have worked on till now.

Project-1:Two Phase Problem to Schedule the Flights by Predicting Airline Delays

Performed airline scheduling based on flight delays and cancellations dataset taken from The U.S. Dept. of Transportation Labs in 2015. 
Developed a ML model using Linear Regression and random forest regression to predict airline delays and random forest performs best with rmse of 1.67 minutes. 
Formulated a MILP model to schedule the aircrafts based on the predictions obtained from the airline delay dataset using Gurobi solver. 
Conducted sensitivity analysis by changing parameters like airport slots,routes to provide managerial insights & improved the model by 14.16%.

Project-2:Prognostic MOdelling of Li-ion Battery Using Convolutional LSTM Technique

Executed data preprocessing techniques on the lithium-ion battery datasets extracted from NASA Prognostic Center of Excellence laboratory. • Applied feature extraction by mutual information regression,yielding relevant features like charging time,max.voltage discharge etc. • Implemented principal component analysis to consider data dimensionality through scree plot, cumulative variance plot. • Developed a convo-lstm model to predict the remaining useful life of Li-ion batteries, employing diverse optimizers (Adam, SGD, RMSprop, Adagrad). • Achieved rmse score of 2.183 by taking all the features and using Adam optimizer. Then, after feature extractions, rmse score of 1.385 is attained. • Utilized first 3 principal components as features for predictions, resulting in a rmse score of 1.207, showcasing the model's best performance.
